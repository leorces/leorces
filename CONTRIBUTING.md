# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all participants in our open-source projects and communities, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract inequality and abuse of power.

## How to Behave

The following behaviors are expected and encouraged from all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.  
- Exercise consideration, respect, and empathy in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different stages of learning when adopting technologies.  
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.  
- Disagreements are fine, but argumentative behavior or trolling is not.  

## How Not to Behave

The following behaviors are unacceptable in our community:

- Threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.  
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.  
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.  
- Posting or threatening to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information ("doxing").  
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.  
- Unwanted sexual attention or advances, including sexualized comments, jokes, or imagery.  
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors.  

Please keep in mind that online communities bring together people from many different cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences combined with online interaction can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. Empathy is key.

## How to Report Issues

If someone is acting inappropriately or violating this Code of Conduct, and they are not receptive to feedback or you prefer not to confront them directly, please reach out to the project maintainers.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers and/or community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
